### ProTools CUI
Like in the previous release, the ProToolsCUI visualizes your selection more effectively!

<img width="1920" height="1017" alt="2025-09-25_13 24 37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4f9734d-479e-45ce-88be-def2ed336275" />

ProTools CUI should not be used with the [ChatTriggers](https://chattriggers.com) module [ProToolsCUI](https://chattriggers.com/modules/v/ProtoolsCUI) by Debug, as
it could cause incompatibility issues. If you want to keep using the ChatTriggers module, turn off ProTools CUI in the configurations:

You are now able to modify your housings even more with complete control over your scoreboard and bossbars visually! This is visible to everyone who is using the mod.
